# Global BGT
A dumb thing that gives you access to functions without including them, because they already  exist. Makes programming easier.

Scripts included:
* dateandtime: Get the date and time easier.
* Speech: Set speech to output to active screen readers (speech.bgt)
* Other scripts are added at random points. I'll write proper docs at some point.

Comments exist, read. Read all day. Read your face off! Well actually it isn't a book - just some simple idea of what that method does.
